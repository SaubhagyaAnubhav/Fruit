The app will feature a searchable fruit database with images, scientific names, nutritional info, advantages, and disadvantages. Users can filter fruits by season, health benefits, or nutrients, and get a daily fruit suggestion with fun facts. Extra features include comparison tools, seasonal notifications, and user-shared recipes, all wrapped in a nature-inspired, minimal UI. Optionally, add a barcode scanner or AR mode for instant fruit recognition and organic verification.
